          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            I'm very comfortable developing in a linux environment due to all the tools/configurations
            I've set up and gotten use to.  When starting my new intern position I was presented with a
            windows machine.  This was no big deal because I was able to just use a virtual machine, putting
            myself in the environment which allows me to have a better workflow.

          <h2>Problems?</h2>
          <p>
            The VM solution is great, being able to run any environment I want.  But I ran into some annoyances.
            <ul>
              <li>Maintenence was annoying</li>
              <li>Spending time troubleshooting issues</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h2>Cue Docker</h2>
          <p>
            Docker is something one always hears talk about and I've done some really basic research into the subject.
            But I've never just dove into using docker because I never thought it would give me any real benefits over
            what I was currently using.
