          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            For about a year I've been developing almost exclusively on linux
            <ul>
              <li>I make use of unix tools</li>
              <li>Have configurations to help my workflow</li>
              <li>Prior to this experience I only had a basic understanding of what Docker could do</li>
              <li>The computer given to me at work was a Windows machine</li>
              <li>I spun up a virtual machine(VM) and after installation and setting up all my tools, was back to where I felt comfortable</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </section>

          <h2>Problems?</h2>
          <p>
            After using a VM for a couple months I ran into some annoyances 
            <ul>
              <li>Had to focus some effort during work to maintenence</li>
              <li>Spending time troubleshooting VM issues was unproductive</li>
              <li>Performance inside the VM was not the best</li>
              <li>Wanted something which didn't require setup or maintenence</li>
              <li>Wanted something which I could create once and never have to worry about it again</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h2>Cue Docker</h2>
          <p>
            What I knew about Docker was...
            <ul>
              <li>Docker used containers and could spin up an exact instance on any machine with Docker installed.</li>
              <li>
                Docker Would allow me to focus on the product, not how to run it
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Couple weeks back I attended a talk where someone demoed building a simple Docker container
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    This showed me what Docker was capable of
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h2>Docker Research</h2>
          <p>
            I started with figuring out what components would be needed for my basic lamp stack
            <ul>
              <li>
                PHP
                <ul>
                  <li>Composer</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Apache Web Server</li>
              <li>MySQL</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
