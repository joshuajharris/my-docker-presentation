          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            I'm very comfortable developing in a linux environment due to all the tools/configurations
            I've set up and gotten use to.  When starting my new intern position I was presented with a
            windows machine.  This was no big deal because I was able to just use a virtual machine, putting
            myself in the environment which allows me to have a better workflow.

          <h2>Problems?</h2>
          <p>
            The VM solution is great, being able to run any environment I want.  But I ran into some annoyances.
            <ul>
              <li>Maintenence was annoying</li>
              <li>Spending time troubleshooting issues was unproductive</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h2>Cue Docker</h2>
          <p>
            What I knew about Docker was...
            <ul>
              <li>Docker used containers and could spin up an exact instance on any machine with Docker installed.</li>
              <li>
                Docker Would allow me to focus on the product, not how to run it
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Couple weeks back I attended a talk where someone demoed building a simple Docker container
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    This showed me what Docker was capable of
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h2>Docker Research</h2>
          <p>
            I started with figuring out what components would be needed for my basci lamp stack
            <ul>
              <li>
                PHP
                <ul>
                  <li>Composer</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Apache Web Server</li>
              <li>MySQL</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
