          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            For about a year I've been developing almost exclusively on linux machines
            <ul>
              <li>I love and make use of unix tools/terminal</li>
              <li>Made configurations to help my workflow</li>
              <li>Love automation and writing scripts to perform repetitive actions</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </section>

          <h2>Problems?</h2>
          <p>
            In my work environment, many people use a windows machine 
            <ul>
              <li>Made me think about how others would work on my project</li>
              <li>My app required php/mysql, which can involve a bit of setup/configuration</li>
              <li>Wanted to make that process as easy as possible</li>
              <li>People who work/contribute to my project should just have to focus on the contribution, not setup</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h2>Cue Docker</h2>
          <p>
            What I knew about Docker was...
            <ul>
              <li>Docker used containers and could spin up an exact instance on any machine with Docker installed.</li>
              <li>
                Docker Would allow me and others to focus on the product, not how to run it
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Couple weeks back I attended a talk where someone demoed building a simple Docker container
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    This showed me what Docker was capable of
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h2>What is Docker</h2>
          <p>
            From Docker's Website
            <blockquote cite="https://www.docker.com/whatisdocker">
              Docker allows you to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development.
            </blockquote>

          <h2>Docker Research</h2>
          <p>
            I started with figuring out what components would be needed for my basic lamp stack because
            Docker would require me to specify exactly what I needed
            <ul>
              <li>
                PHP
                <ul>
                  <li>Composer</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Apache Web Server</li>
              <li>MySQL</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Docker Hub</h2>
          <p>
            To get my Docker container up and running as fast as possible, I searched the Hub for
            containers which others put together and already offered what I needed.
